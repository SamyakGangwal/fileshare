# Internal File Sharing Platform with Real-time Collaboration using Spring Boot

This project aims to develop a secure, real-time document sharing platform for internal team collaboration using Spring Boot and Spring WebFlux. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities and potential implementation:

## Features:

### User Management:
- User registration and login with secure authentication.
- Role-based access control for document permissions (view, edit, share).

### File Sharing:
- Drag-and-drop or browse to upload files (documents, spreadsheets, presentations).
- Secure file storage with access control.
- Version control to track changes and revert to previous versions.

### Real-time Collaboration:
- Users can edit the same document simultaneously.
- Live updates reflected for all collaborators, indicating who is making changes.
- Conflict resolution mechanisms for concurrent edits.

### Messaging and Notifications:
- Real-time chat functionality within documents for collaboration discussions.
- Notifications for file updates, mentions, or permission changes.

## Technical Stack:

- **Frontend:** ReactJS.
- **Backend:** Spring Boot with Spring WebFlux for reactive APIs that handle file uploads, downloads, real-time updates, and communication between users.
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Real-time communication:** Implement WebSockets to enable real-time document updates and chat functionality.

## Implementation Approach:

### User Management:

- Develop user registration and login functionalities using Spring Security.
- Implement a user table in the database to store user credentials and roles.

### File Sharing:

- Create APIs using Spring WebFlux to handle file uploads and downloads.
- Store uploaded files securely in the database (e.g., MongoDB GridFS).
- Maintain a document metadata table to store file details (name, size, owner, version, permissions).

### Real-time Collaboration:

- Utilize a collaborative editing library like Quill or CodeMirror on the frontend for rich text editing.
- Integrate the library with WebSockets to establish real-time connections between users editing the same document.
- Implement mechanisms to send and receive delta updates (changes made by users) and apply them to the collaborative document in real-time.
- Consider using Operational Transformation (OT) libraries for efficient conflict resolution during concurrent edits.

### Messaging and Notifications:

- Integrate a WebSocket chat library like SockJS or Pusher for real-time chat functionalities within documents.
- Develop notification APIs using Spring WebFlux to send alerts for file updates, mentions, or permission changes.
- Utilize a message queuing system like RabbitMQ to handle message delivery and ensure reliability.

## Additional Considerations:

- Implement robust access control mechanisms to ensure document security based on user roles.
- Design a user-friendly interface for version history management and reverting to previous versions.
- Integrate user presence indicators to show which users are currently editing a document.
- Consider scalability aspects for handling a large number of concurrent users and documents.
